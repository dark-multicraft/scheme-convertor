**Usage 📖**

3. Copy the commands generated by the converter site.  
4. Paste the copied commands into a Command Block in your world.  
5. Select 1 block using `//1` and `//2` at the location where you want to place it.  
6. Execute the Command Block.  

**Warning ⚠️**  
- Depending on the size of the object, it may be quite heavy/laggy, so please paste at your own risk.  
- Selecting a wide area with `//1` and `//2` will cause the schematic to distort.  
- Once placed, it cannot be removed with `//undo`, so please test in a safe area first.  
- When using distributed assets, please strictly follow the original terms of use.
